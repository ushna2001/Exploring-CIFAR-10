# Exploring-CIFAR-10
The "Exploring CIFAR-10" repository contains two Jupyter notebooks. The first notebook applies CNN, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers to classify images as either animal or vehicle from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The second notebook, titled "CNN Model for 10 Classes," develops a CNN model to classify all 10 classes of CIFAR-10. In both notebooks, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets, followed by preprocessing steps such as normalization, one-hot encoding, resizing, and flattening of images. The CNN model, in particular, achieved good accuracy, with different hyperparameters being explored to optimize performance and achieve the best results.
